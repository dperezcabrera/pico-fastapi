# Pico-FastAPI v0.2.0 — Ecosystem Integration

This release introduces **native integration with `pico-boot`**, enabling zero-configuration bootstrapping and aligning `pico-fastapi` with the rest of the Pico ecosystem.

No behavioral or middleware changes are included in this version; those were already delivered in prior releases.
v0.2.0 is specifically about **ecosystem consistency and discoverability**.

---

## New: Pico-Boot Auto-Discovery

`pico-fastapi` now defines a standard `entry_point` under:

```
pico_boot.modules
```

This allows `pico-boot` to automatically discover and load `pico-fastapi` when initializing your application.

### Benefits

- No need to manually add `"pico_fastapi"` to your module list
- Consistent module discovery across all Pico libraries (`pico-celery`, `pico-sqlalchemy`, etc.)
- Cleaner, safer, and more declarative bootstrapping
- Fully aligned with the v0.2.0 ecosystem model

## What Does *Not* Change in v0.2.0

To avoid confusion:

* No breaking changes
* No new middleware logic
* No updates to behavior, DI semantics, or FastAPI integration
* No configuration changes

The purpose of this release is **ecosystem alignment only**.

---

## Upgrading

```bash
pip install pico-fastapi==0.2.0
```
